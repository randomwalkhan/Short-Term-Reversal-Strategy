# Reversal 3.5 Live Paper Test

Latest checkpoint (ET): `2026-06-08 05:58:00 EDT`
Last processed slot: `share_ext_0555`

## Active Configuration

- Universe: `qqq_plus_leverage_etfs` (`qqq_only_filtered + SOXL + UPRO + DRAM`)
- Lookback window: `60d`
- Minimum current drop: `> 0.5%`
- Recovery target: `70% of the signal-day drop`
- Success-rate gate: `>= 80%`
- Matched-signal gate: `>= 10`
- Positioning: `50%` target allocation per new entry, up to `2` concurrent tickers
- Entry scan: `3:00 PM ET`
- Early-entry mode: `shadow-only`; `10:00 AM-12:00 PM ET` 5-minute scans still log candidates when `early_entry_score >= 0.67`, success rate `>= 88%`, matched signals `>= 30`, early reclaim `>= 60%`, and recovery stability `>= 0.55`, but they do not open positions
- Exit scans: `9:30 AM ET` and every `30` minutes through `4:00 PM ET`; off-hours `5-minute` checkpoints continue mark-to-market updates for open positions, while any legacy share positions still held from older versions continue extended-hours take-profit and stop loss scans until flat
- Live exit ladder: `+15% / +15% / -10%`
- Option entry liquidity gate: `open interest >= 110`, `volume >= 20`, `spread <= 14%`
- Option exit safety: stale option `lastPrice` may be shown for mark-to-market, but take-profit / stop-loss triggers require an executable quote from bid/ask or bid
- Entry timing overlay: short-window technical-indicator score using a `5d` feature window; only trade when `timing_score >= 0.50`
- Trend-health gate: block candidates in a short-term down channel when 10d return <= `-1.5%` and either log-slope <= `-0.25%/day` below the 10d lookback average or lower-close streak >= `4`
- No-trade rule: if the option is unavailable or fails the liquidity gate, skip the signal rather than falling back into shares
- Extended-hours handling: open option positions continue to refresh their paper marks on off-hours checkpoints; legacy share positions, if any, can still trigger take-profit fills at the target price and stop loss exits at the current visible quote
- Practical live-paper adjustment: entries use the current option mark price; regular-session stop-loss exits book the planned stop level, with no intraday future path otherwise assumed
- Chart views: `Overall / 1D / 1W / 1M`, default open panel is `Overall`
